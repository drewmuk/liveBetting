# NFL & NBA Live

NFL: Using the nflfastR database to get play-by-play data (2019-2021).

NBA: Using a web scraping Python tool to get play-by-play data (2019-2020).

For both sports, I'm calculating the live projections for spread & Over/Under (i.e. Vegas betting lines). Ideally this would match up pretty closely with what the sportsbooks update their lines to in-game, but still be able to exploit the errors or lags in their updates. So far the NBA one has worked pretty well and the NFL one will be tested starting with Week 1.
