# NFL & NBA Live

NFL: Using the nflfastR database to get play-by-play data (2019-2021).

NBA: Using the hoopR package to get play-by-play data (2020-2022).

For both sports, I'm calculating the live projections for spread & Over/Under (i.e. Vegas betting lines). This is supposed to match closely with what the sportsbooks update their lines to in-game, but still be able to exploit the errors or lags in their updates. So far in the 2022 NFL season and 2022-23 NBA season, the models have done just that and have predicted the final margin of victories/total scores more accurately than Bovada Sportsbook does.
